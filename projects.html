                        As a summer project, I began work on a web application called Fantasy Cross Country. Inspired by fantasy football, the application pulls data from various sites to create a fantasy style game. 
                        I developed a custom backend for this using Bun, Auth0 and Express.js. The frontend is built using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. This site gave me a chance to work with Bun's super fast tools for database connections, runtime, and package manager. 
                        The drafting portion of the site using WebSockets for fast, real-time updates. The web-scraping tools are built in Python using the Requests library. By using browser DevTools we are able to use the same API calls the webpage makes to grab the raw information and parse it into our SQL tables.

                    <p>
                        As a short term project, I assisted with the development of a platform called CourseSwap which aimed to help save college students money by showing transfer credits at nearby
                        community colleges and creating customized course plans. During my time there I worked on making build processes more efficient and modern, developed several components in an effort to 
                        improve the UI/UX of the site, and worked on the Python backend.

                    <p>
                        As part of my (high school) senior design project, I and one other implemented a 3D print queuing system using React,
                        MUI, and Firebase. Students can log in with their school Google account and submit print jobs, as well as view the status of printers without being in the room.
                        We also added admin features for faculty to moderate user generated content, and implemented restrictions preventing users from outside the organization from logging in.

                    <p>
                        For another school project, I created a choose your own adventure game, which I originally used for my AP US History "What If" project, but eventually ended up repurposing for other class projects as well.
                        The game is very customizable, includes health and money systems, and was easy to extend when I wanted to use it later. 
                        I wrote it originally using Supabase, React.js, and MUI. (Unfortunately, due to Supabase's free tier limitations, the original game modes we made for these classes have been lost, but the code is still up and available.)
                        I also <i>might</i> rewrite some of it to use something more sustainable long term, like using a static JSON file like I did for my WWII Aircraft Recognition game.

                    <p>
                        For my Freshman year Aviation History and Literature project, I created this game as a fun exploration into React.js and Firebase. Although the original version had a couple of pretty serious bugs
                        (going through 50k Firestore reads in 10 minutes from 5 people using it, anyone?) I eventually ended up shipping a different version several years later without the original leaderboard functionality and authentication system.
                        The version now just pulls static JSON data from the server, which is much simpler to maintain.

                        Another fun project I created my Freshman year for my aspiring entrepreneur friend who was selling candy in school. The site featured a stock system, online ordering, and a blog.
                        I kept the stack simple, and learned how to use hCaptcha and Vercel Serverless Functions for the first time. Orders are submitted to the serverless function, which verifies the hCaptcha code and submits the order,
                        as well as notifying the owners of the business using notifications sent via a webhook to Teams.
